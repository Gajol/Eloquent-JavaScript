## Functional suitability
This characteristic represents the degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions. This characteristic is composed of the following subcharacteristics:

__Functional completeness__
Degree to which the set of functions covers all the specified tasks and user objectives.

__Functional correctness__
Degree to which a product or system provides the correct results with the needed degree of precision.

__Functional appropriateness__
Degree to which the functions facilitate the accomplishment of specified tasks and objectives. These are not architecture characteristics but rather the motivational requirements to build the software. This illustrates how thinking about the relationship between architecture characteristics and the problem domain has evolved. We cover this evolution in Chapter 7.
