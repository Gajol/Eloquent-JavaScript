There are all multi-party computation problems.   The problem we are faced with is a single party (us) however we are forced to use two networks across a single business process, and key information (PII) is not permitted on one entire system.

[data intermediaries](https://cdei.blog.gov.uk/2021/07/22/exploring-the-role-of-data-intermediaries-in-supporting-responsible-data-sharing/): Each time data is shared, accessed, used or protected, a number of stewardship activities would typically take place at the intersection of the data sharing and access journeys. They can include, for example, finding data that is fit-for-purpose, managing transfers and usage rights, and ensuring that the right protections are in place.
