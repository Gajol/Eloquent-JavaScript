- [ ] ?? I had another document with this stuff... - done when composing estimates for Sylvie Work Breakdown Structure.  

# Project Management

## Work Breakdown

PB Cloud
Identity Management
- Identity Impacts:
  1. Global ID : 9-digit - same ID on high & low
  1. Remove legacy-app "identity aspects" - HRMIS Supervisor, Name, etc .

## Usability
From NIST SP 800-63C](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63c.pdf)
[ISO/IEC 9241-11](https://www.iso.org/standard/63500.html) defines usability as the “extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, goals, and context of use as key elements necessary for achieving effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. A holistic approach considering these key elements is necessary to achieve usability.
- we already have user fatigue with:
  - identity management (different identities across various networks)
  - usability (disparate networks and the need for ECC and/or CDS to move information between systems)
  - inadequate tools to find user's identities in different systems

NIST usability considerations/guideliness with identity and authentication:
- minimize user burder (frustration, learning curve, ...)
- consistent experience between IdP and RP
- communication
- help, training
