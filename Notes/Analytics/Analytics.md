1. Predictive Analytics: “The development of probability models based on variables, including historical data related to possible events (purchases, changes in price, etc.).”

2. Prescriptive Analytics: “Anticipates what will happen, when it will happen, and implies why it will happen.”

3. Unstructured Data Analytics: “Combines text mining, association, clustering, and other unsupervised learning techniques to codify large data sets.”

4. Operational Analytics: “The processes of tracking and integrating real-time streams of information, deriving conclusions based on predictive models of behaviour, and triggering automatic responses and alerts.”
