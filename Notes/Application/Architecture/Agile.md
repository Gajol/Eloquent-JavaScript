Manifesto for Agile Software Development
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

# [Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

# Frameworks

- Scrum - [Scrum Definition](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100):
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.  Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers.
In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
  1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
  2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
  3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
  4. Repeat

# SAFe - Agile @ Enterprise Scale
[Scaled Agile Framework - Enterprise (SAFe)](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/safe-lean-agile-principles/)
[Atlassian SAFe Definition](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/what-is-safe) - three primary bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product development, and systems thinking.
  - Note, large companies like Spotify do not follow SAFe.

## SAFe Principles
1. Take an economic view
1. Apply systems thinking
1. Assume variability; preserve options
1. Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
1. Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems
1. Visualize and limit Work In Progress (WIP), reduce batch sizes and manage queue lengths  
1. Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
1. Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
1. Decentralize decision-making
1. Organize around value
