## [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

Manifesto for Agile Software Development
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

## [Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

## Agile Frameworks

- Scrum - [Scrum Definition](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100):
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.  Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers.
In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
  1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
  2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
  3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
  4. Repeat

## SAFe - Agile @ Enterprise Scale
[Scaled Agile Framework - Enterprise (SAFe)](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/safe-lean-agile-principles/)
[Atlassian SAFe Definition](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/what-is-safe) - three primary bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product development, and systems thinking.
  - Note, large companies like Spotify do not follow SAFe.

### SAFe Principles
1. Take an economic view
1. Apply systems thinking
1. Assume variability; preserve options
1. Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
1. Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems
1. Visualize and limit Work In Progress (WIP), reduce batch sizes and manage queue lengths  
1. Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
1. Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
1. Decentralize decision-making
1. Organize around value

## Agile Practices
from LEAN:
- short cycles
- non-negotiable quality
- regular retrospectives
- pulling work from a backlog

## Agile Terms
- MVP - Minmal Viable Product
- MVE - Minimal Viable Experiment
- MMF - Minimal Marketable Feature

## Scrum (and implementation of Agile)
Scrum is a framework utilizing an agile mindset for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment,[1] with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.

- [The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide)
  - in 2011 the term chicken and pigs was removed from the guide.  However, the concept of the roles of members within a scrum still follow the concepts exposed by this metaphor. [The Scrum Guide - Onedrie](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkwXSmFk-_xpgoZ4uAsgORLY1W1rLw?e=FFnaUN)

Pillars: transparency, inspection and adaptation
- transparency: process and work must be visible to those doing the work, and those receive the work
- inspection: the Scrum artifacts and the progress twoard agreed goals must be inspected frequently. (5 events???)
- adaptation: if process aspects deviate outside limits or the product is unacceptable the process or materials must be adjusted

Sprint: four formal events for inspection and adaptation in each sprint; (1) Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, Scrum Artifacts.

Scrum values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage
Scrum team: Scrum Master, one Product Owner, Developers  (no hierarchy on the team)
- cross-functional: all the skills (and trust / access / authority / empowered ) to create value
- responsible for all product related activities {collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research & development, etc }
  - Developers: create a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog.  Quality by adhering to DoD (Definition of Done), adapt plan each day to Sprint Goal, hold each other account as professionals.
  - Product Owner: Developing and communicating Product Goal, creating and communicating Backlog Items, Ordering Product Backlog items, ensuring Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.
  - Scrum Master: establish Scrum (establih Developers with authority), accountable for Scrum Team's effectiveness, focus team on high-value increments, remove blocks/impediments, ensure Scrum events are positive, productive and timeboxed.

  Increment:  The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.  


# Six Sigma (Motorola)
- receipient of [MBNQA award 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Baldrige_National_Quality_Award#Baldrige_Award_Recipients)
- [Six Sigma Overview](https://pecb.com/article/six-sigma-a-case-study-in-motorola)

# Lean Six Sigma
[Lean Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma) is a method that relies on a collaborative team effort to improve performance by systematically removing waste[1] and reducing variation.

It combines lean manufacturing/lean enterprise and Six Sigma to eliminate the eight kinds of waste (muda):
- Defects: the effort for inspecting and fixing defects
- Over-Production: production ahead of demand
- Waiting: waiting for the next production step
- Non-Utilized Talent: Waste of human potential cause usually when management is separated from employees.
- Transportation: moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing
- Inventory: all components, WIP, and finished product not being processed
- Motion: people or equipment moving more than is required
- Extra-Processing: resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity
-*(muda) is Japanese for "futility; uselessness; wastefulness"*

__Caution__: "Lean Six Sigma will be the largest continuous improvement and quality initiative in Nortel’s 110-year history.” – Mike Zafirovski, President and CEO of Nortel [ref: IsixSigma](https://www.isixsigma.com/community/blogs/ellen-bovarnick-nortel-networks/).  

Learning Points: [ref: IsixSigma](https://www.isixsigma.com/community/blogs/ellen-bovarnick-nortel-networks/).  
1. Lean Six Sigma is powerful in improving the pace and quality of innovation
1. Focus on facts and data effectively neutralizes historical bias and emotional attachments
1. Involve product developers
1. Address known pain points, build credibility quickly
1. Consider the whole system first then customize to meet business and customer needs

Limitations of early Lean Six Sigma:  ( I guess O'Reilly book offers solutoin...)
1. Still not appropriate for all problems
1. Does not incorporate routine problem solving
1. Does not provide a complete quality management system
1. Cannot efficiently handle large, complex, and unstructured problems
1. Does not take advantage of Big Data analytics
1. Does not address modern risk management issues

Organizations that apply for the MBNQA are judged by an independent board of examiners. Recipients are selected based on achievement and improvement in seven areas, known as the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence:
- Leadership: How upper management leads the organization, and how the organization leads within the community.
- Strategy: How the organization establishes and plans to implement strategic directions.
- Customers: How the organization builds and maintains strong, lasting relationships with customers.
- Measurement, analysis, and knowledge management: How the organization uses data to support key processes and manage performance.
- Workforce: How the organization empowers and involves its workforce.
- Operations: How the organization designs, manages, and improves key processes.
- Results: How the organization performs in terms of customer satisfaction, finances, human resources, supplier and partner performance, operations, governance and social responsibility, and how the organization compares to its competitors.



# Quality Standards
ISO 9000 - see [ASQ Standards](https://asq.org/quality-resources/standards-101)
The ISO 9000 family of standards addresses quality management. This means what the organization does to fulfill:
—the customer's quality requirements, and
—applicable regulatory requirements, while aiming to
—enhance customer satisfaction, and
—achieve continual improvement of its performance in pursuit of these objectives.

The ISO 14000 family addresses environmental management. This means what the organization does to:
—minimize harmful effects on the environment caused by its activities, and to
—achieve continual improvement of its environmental performance

- Jokes Deming liked; *Murphy was an optimist...*

## Deming Cycle : Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)

Use the PDCA cycle when:
- Starting a new improvement project
- Developing a new or improved design of a process, product, or service
- Defining a repetitive work process
- Planning data collection and analysis in order to verify and prioritize problems or root causes
- Implementing any change
- Working toward continuous improvement

The Plan-do-check-act Procedure
- Plan: Recognize an opportunity and plan a change.
- Do: Test the change. Carry out a small-scale study.
- Check: Review the test, analyze the results, and identify what you’ve learned.
- Act: Take action based on what you learned in the study step.

If the change did not work, go through the cycle again with a different plan. If you were successful, incorporate what you learned from the test into wider changes. Use what you learned to plan new improvements, beginning the cycle again.

## Kanban

Kanban:  (Japanese: 看板, meaning signboard or billboard) is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.[Kanban - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development))

- [Allen Holub - Agility - Essential Reading](https://holub.com/reading/)
- Two primary practices are to visualize your work and to limit work in progress (WIP)
- Kanban metrics include:
  - Team velocity defines how many tasks a team can deliver in a given period of time, for example a week or iteration.
  - Lead and Cycle time defines the average time it takes to complete a task.
  - Actionable Agile metrics use cycle time to better predict when each project item is going to be finished. [recent: 2015 concept]
