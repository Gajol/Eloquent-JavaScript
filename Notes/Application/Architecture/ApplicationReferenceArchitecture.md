- [ ] - Applicability to Agile - from [Gartner 2021 - How to Document Application Architecture - G00750245](https://www.gartner.com/document/4008341) *Which framework you use matters less than using a framework in the first place. Bear in mind that the more heavyweight and prescriptive the framework is, the less well-suited it is to agile development. If your internal processes call for you to create detailed architecture documentation in the early phases of a development effort, then theyâ€™re not agile.*

# Forward
- discuss "agile vs documentation"
- discuss imposter syndrome : review is for collaboration not to pass/fail
  - [Your insecurities aren't what you think they are - Adam Grant](https://www.ted.com/talks/worklife_with_adam_grant_your_insecurities_aren_t_what_you_think_they_are/up-next)
    - Don't only take on tasks where you know you can succeed
    - Understand failing does not translate to being a failure
    - Focus on intrinsic motivation vs extrinsic, don't always go looking for external validation, there will always be someone that takes issue with what you have done
    - Focus on getting better not looking good
# Introduction

# Guidelines

## UX Design
- follow GC User Centric Design
- see deisgn mothers for Ux - on CW - [UK 18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/) - referenced by GC standards - [18f technoloyg and design company - USA ](https://18f.gsa.gov/)

# Terms

- System:
- Solution:

## CNA
- CNA: Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.
- Kubernetes is a platform to manage, host, scale, and deploy containers.
- Containers are a portable way of packaging and running code. They are well suited to the microservices pattern, where each microservice can run in its own container.

# Templates
This section addresses the lack of standards, templates and clear requirements for documentation.

# Goal
- *At the end of the day, I want my artifacts to be enduring. My goal is to create a prescriptive, semi-formal architectural description that can be used as a basis for setting department priorities, parallelizing development, [managing] legacy migration, etc.*
