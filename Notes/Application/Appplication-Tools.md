ZenUML was born from a Finance project and is widely used in Bank, FinTech, Telecom, and Retail companies. From day one, we built ZenUML in a way that no data is sent to our server for rendering including image-export. No personal data is stored, transmitted, or otherwise processed by ZenUML’s server.
