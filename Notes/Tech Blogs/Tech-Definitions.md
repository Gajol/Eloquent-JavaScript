## PURL resolvers (one operated by US Government Printing)
[Federal Depository Library Program](https://purl.fdlp.gov/index.html)
The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) operates the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), which was established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Governmentâ€™s information. As part of its mission, the FDLP acquires and distributes federal information to the American public both online and through Federal Depository Libraries located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.

As part of the online dissemination of federal information, the FDLP uses persistent uniform resource locators (PURLs) to provide stable URLs to online federal information. When a user clicks on a PURL, the request is routed to the federal publication. As federal agencies redesign and remove information from their sites, GPO staff reroute PURL entries to the appropriate location.
Includes a [catalog to search PURLS](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F?RN=188854198)

## Comparing with permalink
Both [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink) and PURL are used as permanent/persistent URL and redirect to the location of the requested web resource. Roughly speaking, they are the same. Their differences are about domain name and time scale:

- A permalink usually does not change the URL's domain, and is designed to persist over years.
- A PURL domain name is independently changeable, and is designed to persist over decades.
