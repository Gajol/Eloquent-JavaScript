## DevOps Practices
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous deployment
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Monitoring : monitor for performance, - defects, security and compliance (compute, network, - storage, customer activities, security and IM policies)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Microservices



# Deployment Pipelines
[BMC Deployment Pipelines CI/CD](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/deployment-pipeline/)
Components of a pipeline:
- Build Automation / Continuous Integration
- Test automation
- Deploy automation

Pipeline tool cateogries:
- Source Control
- Build tools
- Containerisation
- Configuration management
- Monitoring



## Configuration management
[BMC Configuration Management](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/devops-configuration-management/)Configuration management occurs when a configuration platform is used to automate, monitor, design and manage otherwise manual configuration processes. System-wide changes take place across servers and networks, storage, applications, and other managed systems.

An important function of configuration management is defining the state of each system. By orchestrating these processes with a platform, organizations can ensure consistency across integrated systems and increase efficiency. The result is that businesses can scale more readily without hiring additional IT management staff. Companies that otherwise wouldnâ€™t have the resources can grow by deploying a DevOps approach.

Configuration management is closely associated with change management, and as a result, the two terms are sometimes confused. Configuration management is most readily described as the automation, management, and maintenance of configurations at each state, while change management is the process by which configurations are redefined and changed to meet the conditions of new needs and dynamic circumstances.

# Automation

## Accenture - 4S Model
Simple, Seemless, Scalable, Sustaibable.
- [OneDrive - Accenture 4S Model Automation - 2021](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkwXSmFk-_xpgocptgZ5ui1c7J7jcw?e=LDsK5l) - first step is to apply techniques like lean principles and six sigma.
  - Simple : Make automation simple by identifying the right opportunities/use cases with the biggest impact to business
  - Seamless : Make automation seam-less for use and adoption, so there is an ROI to the business
  - Scalable : Make automation scalable across the enterprise so there is full realization of the automation value for the business
  - Sustainable : Make automation sustainable and continuously evolving to ensure continuous value generation

  1. Systems Thinking - emphasize the performance of the entire system verus silos
  1. Amplify Feedback Loops - process improvement goals to shorten feedback loops so corrections can be made
  1. Culture - Continual Learning and Experimentation
