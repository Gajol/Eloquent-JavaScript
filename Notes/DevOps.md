## Configuration management
[BMC Configuration Management](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/devops-configuration-management/)Configuration management occurs when a configuration platform is used to automate, monitor, design and manage otherwise manual configuration processes. System-wide changes take place across servers and networks, storage, applications, and other managed systems.

An important function of configuration management is defining the state of each system. By orchestrating these processes with a platform, organizations can ensure consistency across integrated systems and increase efficiency. The result is that businesses can scale more readily without hiring additional IT management staff. Companies that otherwise wouldnâ€™t have the resources can grow by deploying a DevOps approach.

Configuration management is closely associated with change management, and as a result, the two terms are sometimes confused. Configuration management is most readily described as the automation, management, and maintenance of configurations at each state, while change management is the process by which configurations are redefined and changed to meet the conditions of new needs and dynamic circumstances.
