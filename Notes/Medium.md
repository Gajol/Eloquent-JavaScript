- Proofreading my articles (I use Grammarly plus manual proofreading)
- Carefully pick photos that are beautiful, relevant and license-free ( - Unsplash images are a great source and built into Mediumâ€™s editor UI)
- Contemplate a good title/subtitle thatâ€™s catchy yet not cliche
- Creating my own GIF animation wherever I can to inject more â€˜energyâ€™ into - my page.
- Cross-reference sources and embed videos wherever relevant to offer - richer background knowledge. (Also to my own articles too, of course ðŸ˜‰)
- Make full use of Mediumâ€™s rich editing and layout tools, like emoji, â€˜@â€™, - blockquote, etc. to make the story less boring and more vibrant to the - eyes.
- Contemplating good tags that are diversified and also relevant to increase reach.
